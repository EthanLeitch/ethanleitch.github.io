This website was made with [svelte + astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/svelte/), and [shadcn-svelte](shadcn-svelte.com) for the UI.
If you want to run this site locally (for some reason) and you're not me, the first two commands here should help.

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

Meow!
